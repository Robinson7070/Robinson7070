# Hi, I’m Victor Chukwudi Robinson 👋

### Artificial Intelligence & Data Science | MSc @ University of London | Applied ML, AI Systems & Responsible AI

I work across the full AI lifecycle, from data engineering and model development to evaluation, deployment considerations, and governance. Currently completing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, my focus is on building robust, interpretable, and deployment-ready AI systems for real-world use.

My interests span applied machine learning, healthcare AI, data-driven decision systems, and emerging AI governance frameworks — with an emphasis on designing systems that perform reliably under real-world constraints.

## 🚀 What I Work On

* 🧠 **Applied Machine Learning & Deep Learning** Building and evaluating models for classification, prediction, clustering, and decision support using both classical ML and neural approaches.
* 🏥 **Healthcare & High-Stakes AI** Designing AI pipelines for safety-critical domains, incorporating human-in-the-loop decision-making, explainability, and risk-aware evaluation.
* 🔍 **Data Engineering & Model Evaluation** Focusing on data quality, preprocessing pipelines, feature engineering, and monitoring for bias and drift.
* ⚖️ **Responsible & Explainable AI** Integrating interpretability, auditability, and governance considerations aligned with emerging regulatory standards like the **EU AI Act**.
* 🧩 **End-to-End AI Systems** Thinking beyond models to the full system: data → preprocessing → model → evaluation → human decision-making.
